This is my personal fork of [FrogPilot](https://github.com/FrogAi/FrogPilot). **This fork contains lots of code changes considered "unsafe" by comma.ai and will get your device banned from their servers if uploading is enabled. Uploads are disabled by default, however logging is still enabled. Be sure to delete all logs before switching to another fork or enabling uploads to avoid getting your device banned.** While the base FrogPilot fork that this is built on top of is primarily geared toward Toyota/Lexus, this is primarily geared toward HKG CAN-FD vehicles, more specifically my Kia EV6.

**This fork is purely a personal project and is not affiliated with FrogAi or FrogPilot in any way. Use at your own risk.**

Having said that, in addition to the features and improvements included from [FrogAi/FrogPilot](https://github.com/FrogAi/FrogPilot), here are some added highlights:

 - Customizable steering torque values
 - Customizable offline and live lateral tuning values (stock torque controller only, does not apply if using [twilsonco's NNFF](https://github.com/twilsonco/openpilot))
 - Toggles to turn off driver monitoring, door open alerts, and seatbelt unlatched alerts
 - Toggle to add a "target locked" animation to the lead car in the on road UI (credit goes to [programanichiro](https://github.com/programanichiro/openpilot))
 - Opweb - access routes, modify parameters, and apply updates via web browser (credit goes to [Jacob Pfeifer](https://github.com/pfeiferj/pfeifer-pilot-patches))
 - Various small tweaks and improvements:
     - Use the more fine-grained MDPS steering angle sensor for HKG CAN-FD vehicles
     - Less sensitive steer saturated alerts
     - Faster auto tune for the stock torque controller
     - Display the current branch in the startup alert
     - Ability to set more aggressive follow distances for the driving personalities
     - "AEB disabled" icon removed and the dash matches the stock dash when using openpilot longitudinal
